## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard presents interactive visualizations and modelling results that capture the **flood risk dynamics in Assam** over a 25-year period (2000–2024). The study investigates how **urbanisation**, reflected through **proxy indicators** like electricity consumption, road construction, drainage coverage, and land-use change, has intensified flood frequency and magnitude.

The aim is to **quantify these relationships** using robust statistical and machine learning models, and to enhance interpretability using **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**.

---

## ❓ Research Questions

This dissertation addresses the core question:  
**“How does urbanisation impact Assam floods?”**, by answering the following:

1. **How do urbanisation and its proxy variables impact flood counts in Assam?**
2. **How can XAI techniques help uncover the decision-making logic of complex AI/statistical models?**
3. **What actionable insights can policymakers derive for data-driven flood resilience?**

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Models used**: ARIMA, ARIMAX, GLM (Negative Binomial), GAM, Random Forest  
- **XAI Techniques applied**:
  - SHAP Summary Plots
  - SHAP Over Time (Temporal Heatmaps)
  - Waterfall Decomposition
  - Rule Extraction from Random Forest

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Domestic Electricity Consumption** and **Built-Up Land** emerged as the strongest contributors to rising flood risk.
- **Drainage coverage** and **State GDP** had complex or model-specific effects—sometimes acting as mitigating factors.
- Results showed that **urban road construction**, when crossing certain thresholds, sharply increases predicted floods.

---

## 🧭 Primary Data Integration

A primary survey of **70 Guwahati residents** was conducted to complement secondary data analysis. Key findings:

- **70%** of respondents reported having basic emergency supplies.
- **Only 31/70** were willing to purchase flood insurance.
- Less than **⅓** knew the location of their nearest flood shelter.
- The constructed **Flood Awareness Index** (FRATPI) and **Social Vulnerability Index** (SoVI) validated model-based hotspots.

---

## 🏛️ Policy Recommendations

Derived from XAI results and primary insights:

- Strengthen drainage systems in high-risk urban clusters.
- Mandate flood zoning in urban planning approvals.
- Improve early warning dissemination and flood literacy.
- Establish a **centralised data infrastructure** for monthly, high-resolution tracking of:
  - Land use
  - Electricity demand
  - Infrastructure growth
  - Real-time flood incidents

---

## 🎯 Impact & Future Directions

This project offers a scalable framework for **data-informed flood management**, blending quantitative forecasting with interpretable insights. It contributes to climate adaptation strategies by:

- Empowering policymakers with **explainable** model logic.
- Bridging the gap between public perception and data-driven planning.
- Advocating for **granular, integrated datasets** to improve forecasting accuracy and policy precision.
