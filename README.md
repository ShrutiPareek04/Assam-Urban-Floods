The dashboard presents all visualizations essential for analyzing and understand the Flood Risk Dynamics of Assam - and the impact of Urbanization over the last 24 years. The study focuses on how proxy indicators such as electricity consumption, urban road construction, drainage expansion, and land use change influence flood frequency. The objective is to quantify these relationships and generate explainable, policy-relevant insights through a data-driven modelling framework supported by Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

The dissertation revolves around the core research question – “How does urbanization impact Assam Floods?” addressing it using three segments:

1. How does urbanization and its proxy variables impact floods in Assam?
2. How can XAI techniques be effectively used to build an understanding of the decision-making process of complex statistical and AI models?
3. What are some key insights, the policymakers can derive for data-driven policy enhancements?

The study begins with the development of a blend of statistical and machine learning models, including ARIMA, ARIMAX, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Random Forests, to model flood counts based on proxy indicators of urbanisation. Model performance is assessed using accuracy metrics, and interpretability is achieved through XAI tools such as SHAP summary plots, SHAP-over-time heatmaps, rule extraction, and waterfall additive breakdowns.

Findings reveal that increased electricity use and built-up land consistently elevate flood risk, while drainage infrastructure and GDP exhibit more complex or model-specific roles. A supplementary primary survey of 70 Guwahati residents further supports these conclusions, capturing local risk perception, preparedness behaviors, and social vulnerability indices. The triangulation of model predictions and public perception highlights systemic gaps in institutional preparedness and urban planning.

The research culminates in a set of data-informed policy recommendations, advocating for better drainage maintenance, community-level preparedness, and the establishment of a centralised, high-resolution data infrastructure. These findings aim to guide climate-resilient flood management strategies in Assam and similar urbanising regions.
